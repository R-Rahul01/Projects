The Campus Fundraiser application is a digital platform designed to streamline and enhance 
fundraising efforts within educational institutions such as colleges and universities.A Fund raising is not about businesses being nice to a 
not-for-profit for the sake of being nice. Any college event usually involves 3 ways of need satisfaction. 
Participantâ€™s satisfaction. Sponsors making out of the PR and maker or their product/service. 
Organizers making money and PR .Now assuming that you have thoroughly planned out on points 1 
and 3. You look at sponsors. Sponsors look out to people who can add value either in the form of PR 
or Revenue or both. As MNCs are tough to crack I'd suggest that Emerging start-ups are a big win for 
all your sponsorships. All they ask for is good PR and great branding. Food brands like Dominos etc 
will give you a crack out of their generating revenue while their sales in your college event. In return 
they ask or a stall space and branding .If there is a technical touch o your college events, start-ups in 
requirement of interns for their functionality would love to sponsor(read invest) and attract good 
manpower and talent from the college events.
